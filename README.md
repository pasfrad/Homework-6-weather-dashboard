# Homework-6-weather-dashboard

This is the homework for the last week of the first unit of Bootcamp. It involves the use of JQuery, Bootstrap, third-party APIs, and more. They are used to create a dashboard into which a user can search a city and receive several parameters of weather data for it. They can also repeat their recent searches using the right-hand buttons that pop up when a search is made.
